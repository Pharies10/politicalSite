        <h2> At a small school in Danville, Kentucky, five students would begin a movement to change the direction of the conservative narrative. Frustrated with the status quo, they used their unique backgrounds to create a new political party. Together they would be the five founders of the Young Federalists.
Today they are known as the Federalist Five.

        <h3>Mea Parachini:</h3> A college student from Colorado, Mea Parachini falls into the category of frequently overwhelmed, constantly sleep-deprived, and occasionally overdramatic. When her fascination with history and devotion to Hamilton: An American Musical coalesced into a desire to step back (in time) from mainstream politics, the idea of a party fit for a Founding Father seemed the best course of action. Right-wing and proud of it, she can often be found reading up on the latest political developments and holding back sarcastic comments with something caffeinated in hand. Don’t worry: she’ll defend your rights even in her sleep (or lack thereof)-she does believe in the Ten (Duel) Commandments religiously, after all.

        <h3>Kit Haist:</h3> A native-born Kentuckian and a proud patriot. When she lived in Philadelphia, she discovered a love for her country’s rich history. However, she also grew to learn the current American government betrayed many of the principles our founding fathers held dear. Upon enrolling in Centre College, Kit was grateful to befriend individuals who felt similarly. She is equally grateful to call herself a founding member of the Young Federalists. When she isn’t dedicating her time to ensuring the next generation is guaranteed a voice, Kit is likely studying the work of the Old Masters, listening to the Dixie Chicks, or reading such authors as Adam Smith and Sir Walter Scott.

        <h3>Arthur Jenkins:</h3> A native son of the great state of Tennessee, and a proud patriot. Arthur was raised on the values of liberty and justice that make this country great. He regards the founding fathers as the creators of the greatest force in the universe, AMERICA. While moving to Kentucky to further his education, Arthur met like-minded patriots, upset with the current state of Washington, and together they founded the Young Federalists in hopes of giving the government back to the people. When he is not spreading the word to the next generation, he is listening to Garth Brooks and studying his copy of the constitution.

        <h3>Jack Pharies:</h3> Born in San Diego, California, Jack was always the known patriot of his class moving through grade school. Moving to Kentucky to continue his education, he was lucky enought to meet other like him. After graduating with a degree in Computer Science, he worked with his fellow founders to create the Young Federalists with the desire to change the conservative party to be one for the people. Now, he is often giving speeches about the intersection of technology and politics or the implications of social media to the political landscape at colleges. However, when he is not traveling he could be spotted at a local coffee shop drinking to much coffee and reading a novel.
